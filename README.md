# Iris Dataset Analysis 🌸

## 📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates how to perform basic data loading, exploration, analysis, and visualization using the **Iris dataset**. The dataset is widely used for pattern recognition tasks and contains measurements for iris flowers from three species.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Load and analyze a dataset using `pandas`.
- Visualize data using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- Understand trends and patterns through summary statistics and plots.

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 📊 Tasks Performed
### Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset
- Loaded Iris dataset using `sklearn.datasets`
- Displayed the first few rows
- Checked data types and missing values

### Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
- Summary statistics with `.describe()`
- Grouped by species and computed feature means

### Task 3: Data Visualization
- Line chart of average features per species
- Bar chart of petal length by species
- Histogram of sepal length
- Scatter plot: sepal vs. petal length

## 🔍 Observations
- Setosa species is clearly separable from others.
- Petal length is a strong differentiator across species.
- No missing values in this dataset.

## ▶️ How to Run
Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and run all cells.
